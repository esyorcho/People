# People

Console application written in .NET Core.
Uses HttpClient to read an external api and with the data it performs 3 operations:
1. Return the full name of the user with id 42
2. Return all the users first names who are 23 years old separated by commas
3. Return the gender count grouped by age ordered from youngest to oldest

There's still pending tests and better error handling.
